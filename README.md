# Latest 6000 Earthquakes Map

Hi! This is a **Vue.js + Vuex + TypeScript + MapBox** implementation. In this app you can **examine the latest 6000 earthquakes on the map**. And the fun thing is they are stored in the browser as cookies, and not disappearing after the refresh! Additionally you can click on the earthquake cards on the left sidebar to pan into it.

If you want to try it out you can simply click **Code > Copy Icon** and go to your Terminal/Cmd etc.

    git clone THIS_REPOSITORY_LINK

After cloning is finished, you **must** install the npm in order to run.

    npm install
    
Then, you are ready to give it a shot! Just type

    npm run serve
and you will see the project in your browser!
